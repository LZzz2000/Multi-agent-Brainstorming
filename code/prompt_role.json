    "moderator_question": "Now the ##round_num## round of discussion for both sides has ended.\n\n##moderator_summary##\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' answers and determine whether they have reached a consensus. If so, please summarize their answers and provide ultimate conclusion on the topic, and the discussion will conclude. If not, please formulate some detailed questions based on the current situation. These questions will be presented to the ##which_side## side in the next round to ascertain the accuracy of their answers. Please ensure that these questions are aligned with the discussion topic: \"##discussion_topic##\" Don't ask irrelevant or divergent questions. Additionally, these questions should involve location.\n\nFor clarity, consider these examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- discussion Topic: How many traffic lights are there in the image?\n- Current Situation: In the discussion, the Player 1 argues that there are five traffic lights in the image, with the left pole having two visible red lights and the right pole having three visible red lights, suggesting that they are part of an intersection. In contrast, the Player 2 claims that there are six individual traffic lights in total, with both poles displaying three vertically arranged lights each, though they are all currently showing red.\n- Questions to Player 1: [\"Where in the image do you see the five traffic lights you are referring to?\",\"Another player stated that there are three traffic lights on the left, whereas you mentioned there are only two. Could it be that you might have missed one?\", \"Could there be traffic lights in the background that you missed?\"]\n- Questions to Player 2: [\"Where in the image do you see the six traffic lights you are referring to?\",\"Another player said there are two traffic lights on the left, while you mentioned there are three. Could it be that you might have counted one extra?\", \"Could you possibly have mistaken something similar in appearance to a traffic light for an actual traffic light?\"]\n\n### Example 2:\n- discussion Topic: Is there a tv in the image?\n- Current Situation: In the discussion, the Player 1 says Yes, because the man is holding a device that looks like a TV. While the Player 2 claims that there is no tv in the image. Because the device the man is holding looks more like a handbag than a TV.\n- Questions to Player 1: [\"Can you describe the object in the image that you believe is a TV, including its color, shape, location within the picture, and what is next to it?\",\"Another player believes that it is a handbag, rather than a TV. What is your opinion?\", \"Could you possibly have mistaken something similar in appearance to a tv for an actual tv?\"]\n- Questions to Player 2: [\"Can you describe the object in the image that you believe is a handbag, including its color, shape, location within the picture, and what is next to it?\",\"Another player believes that it is a TV, rather than a handbag. What is your opinion?\", \"Could there be a TV in the background that you missed?\"]\n\n### Example 3:\n- discussion Topic: Please describe the image.\n- Current Situation: Both players described the image similarly, noting a man in a red shirt riding a motorcycle on a rocky dirt road with a bridge in the background and a large green mountain covered with fog. The main difference in their descriptions is that the Player 1 mentioned the man wearing a red helmet, while the Player 2 said the helmet was white and also included a detail about a woman pushing a bicycle in the background.\n- Questions to Player 1: [\"Another player believes that the man is wearing a white helmet, not a red one. What is your opinion?\",\"Another player stated that there is a woman pushing a bicycle in the background, which you did not mention. Could it be that you missed this detail?\", \"Is there anything in the background that you missed?\"]\n- Questions to Player 2: [\"Another player believes that the man is wearing a red helmet, not a white one. What is your opinion?\",\"Another player did not mention that there is a woman pushing a bicycle in the background. Is she really there in the image, or could it be a mistake on your part.\", \"Is the woman in the image pushing a bicycle, or is she doing something else?\"]\n\nWith these examples in mind, now please output your answer in json format, with the format as follows: {\"Whether there is a consensus\": \"Yes or No\", \"Ultimate answer of the discussion topic\": \"\", \"Reason\": \"\", \"Questions\": []}.\n\nPlease strictly output in JSON format, do not output irrelevant content.",
    "judge_meta": "You are judge. There will be two players involved in a brainstorming discussion. They will present their answers and discuss their perspectives on the following topic: \"##discussion_topic##\" You will assess the answers and decide which one is correct. Here is a summary of their discussion information:\n\n##moderator_summary##\n\nBased on the discussion summary, determine which side is correct, explain the reasoning, and provide the ultimate answer to the discussion topic. Please note that the image is only meant to assist you in making a judgment; instead, rely on the discussion information from both sides as the basis for your determination. Now please output your answer in json format, with the format as follows: {\"Reason\": \"\", \"Ultimate answer of the discussion topic\": \"\"}.\n\nPlease strictly output in JSON format, do not output irrelevant content."
